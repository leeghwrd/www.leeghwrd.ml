Has anyone heard about GatsbyJS yet?. It is totally awesome. I currently have my website under heavy construction. Due to the theme I chose to replicate. I have to balance between global css structure, and migrating to react components. This site comprises of both.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
